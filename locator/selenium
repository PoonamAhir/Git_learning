Selenium:
Is inbuild with lot's of attribute, module and packages
Interaction with web element:
methods: any application ->username, password, login, forget, signup.

Automation ->Testing the functionality of the application by using
            application tool is called "Automation".

web-elements:
- anything (data) which is present in the web application called "web-element"
- location in the web page/element user wants to interact

There are two types:
1. Web-element  ->Single element
2. Web-elements ->Multiple elements

shortcut->to see html data in the web page(inspect) ->ctl+shift+i.

why/uses:
1. To reduce the human error in the repetitive task
2. Maintain the Accuracy and consistency
3. sustain the market

class ->attribute present in the web page
class name: locator present in the selenium

Imp: if there is any space in the locator value, the user should replace it with dot(.)

To enter data: send_keys(" ") is used
e.g: driver.find_element("","").send_keys()

webdriver -> In java it is interface, and In Python it is Module
Locator -> Finding and inspecting an element in a webpage is called "Locator".
why Locators: Before performing any actions like clicking, selection, and entering ...etc
               we have to find the path of element because selenium doesn't know where the
               element present in the webpage

Types of Locator:
1. Id
2. name
3. class name
4. Tag name
5. link text
6. partial link text
7. css selector
8. xpath

To Find web element is a web page we have two options:
1. web element(): To find single web element.
2. web elements(): To find multiple web elements.

Syntax: return type of this method is web element, two arguments.
    find_element("locator_name", "locator_value")

Three possibilities:
1. It should have match with exactly one element.
2. If the locator value matches with multiple elements then it will return first element address.
3. If the locator value not matches with any element then it will return 'No such exception" result.

"InvalidArgumentException" ->in case wrong id is is given.
"NoSuchElementException"  ->in case wrong value is given.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
HTML consist of three element:
1. Tagname
2. Attribute
3. Text

e.g: <a href:"https://www.google.com" <Google> </a>
1.Tagname: a
2. Attribute: href:"https://www.google.com"
3. Text : Google.

-If the locator value matches with multiple elements in that case data will enter into the first element.
-If the locator values matches with multiple elements in that case to find out perticular element we can use find_elements()

------------------------------
verification method:
-tile
-pagesource
-current URL

1. verifyTitle(): checks if the title matches with the expected title.
2. verifyTest(): checks if a specific text is present on a web page or element.
3. verifyelementpresent(): verifies if specifc element(like, button, link, image) exist on the page.
4. verifyelementeEnabled() confirms whether an element is enabled(usable)
5. verifyURL():  verified whether the current URL matches the expected URl.
6. verifyattribute(): confirms if an element's attribute has the correct value.
